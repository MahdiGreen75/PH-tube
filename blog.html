                <p>
                    <span>Answer :</span>
                    <span>Here, is a detailed answer of the scope of var, let, and const</span>
                <ol>

                    <li>
                        Var declaration has function-level scope, meaning it's accessible throughout the entire function
                        it's declared in. If declared outside a function, it becomes a global variable accessible from
                        anywhere in the script. Variables declared with `var` are hoisted, which can sometimes lead to
                        unexpected behavior when they are used before declaration.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Let has block-level scope, limited to the block (enclosed by curly braces) it's declared in,
                        including loops, conditional statements, and function blocks. Variables declared with `let` are
                        not hoisted, making them more predictable than `var`.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        const also has block-level scope like `let`. Requires initialization when declared and cannot be
                        reassigned once a value is assigned. Suitable for defining constants or values that should not
                        change.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    In summary, `var` has broader scope, `let` and `const` have narrower block-level scope, and
                    `const`
                    enforces immutability once assigned. Developers often prefer `let` and `const` for their more
                    predictable scoping and safety features.
